# Reverse Engineering Arcaea

!!! danger "Before starting"
    This page is being actively worked on. Content shown below may be unfinished, unpolished, out of date, or inaccurate.

    This guide is **NOT** beginner-friendly and you will have to figure out a lot of things yourself. Only proceed if you know what you are doing.

!!! tip "About modifying instructions/NOPing"
    A frequent thing you will be told to do throughout this guide is to NOP or edit an instruction. There are two main ways of doing so:

    * Overwriting its hex address using a hex editor. This will requires a converter that allows converting ARM instruction to hex address and vice versa. As with NOPing an instruction, overwrite its hex address with `1F 20 03 D5` for ARM64 or `00 F0 20 E3` for ARM32. This is the recommended method.

    * Using [Keypatch](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keypatch). This is the simplest method to directly modifying an instruction without having to touch the hex editor. Unfortunately, Keypath has not been updated to IDA Pro 8.x (yet), and even with older versions of IDA Pro setting it up and get it to work can be quite a pain.

## Removing hash verification
!!! tip "Info"
    Allows making changes to the game files. **Only for pre-5.4.0 and Chinese versions.**

In the **Functions** sub-window on the left, right click on **Function name** and choose **Quick filter**, then search for `.exit` (Android) or `_exit` (iOS).

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/74685931/49292eca-76de-4e01-aba3-426f81ff252f)

Double-click onto it, and on the **IDA View** sub-window, press **SPACE** to switch to graph view. You will be presented with something like this, click onto the highlighted button to bring up the xref (cross-reference) window.

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/74685931/c56c9821-e639-41a7-ad8f-6c734b1e8e35)

Choose the first (Android) or second (iOS) xref entry.

!!! note
    In case neither of entries contains what is shown below, trying looking at other entries too. Please do note that if you are modding a version of Arcaea that uses content bundle (5.4.0+), you will not be able to find it as it does not exist.

=== "iOS"
    
    There are 9 xref entries consisting of 6 B.NE and 3 CBNZ instructions, NOP all of them until there are none left.

    ![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/74685931/f9d95838-4b71-4512-b6a5-af302901c162)

=== "Android"
    
    There are 6 xref entries consisting of 3 B.NE and 3 CBNZ instructions, NOP all of them until there are none left.

    ![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/74685931/c491b324-8d95-4d8b-b179-287fbc5d8402)

## Removing lock icon
!!! tip "Info"
    Remove the lock icon on locked packs. Purely for aesthetic purposes.

Press **SHIFT + F12**, then **ALT + T** and search for `lock_icon`. Double-click onto it and xref it. After that, press **TAB** or **F5** to view its pseudo-code, you will see something like this:

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/74685931/18cecc88-a2c8-44ba-ab0b-439b560a1ceb)

Find this structure and highlight `v132` (name may be different), then xref it, Choose the first entry.

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/74685931/9c2c9bd8-ad5f-4f15-8939-d5264add4e40)

Double-click onto the function call to view its pseudo-code. Focus on this part.

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/74685931/55f6a995-5064-4640-bc10-2764bf7babca)

Highlight it then switch back to the **IDA View** sub-window. With synchronization enabled, modify `MOV  W8, 0` to `MOV  W8, 1`. Repeat this for both of the variables. After doing so, all `v3` variables should have `1` as its value.

    VII. Remove Skynote and Arc restrictions (over y2.1)

    Note: Not recommended having these 2 modded because it'll mess up a part in Singularity VVVIP. See here: https://youtu.be/3SBjWP2JEXc?t=93.

    a. Skynote
    
    Xref [The Switch](#the-switch-this-will-be-used-for-others-as-well-1), switch to **IDA-View** and scroll up a bit until you found this:

    Use the Keypatcher to `nop` for the `FMOV` and `TBZ W20` opcode.

    b. Arc
    
    In the **Pseudocode** view, scroll up, xref [The Skynote](#Skynote-1) first address, scroll up again, xref the first address, switch to **IDA-View**, AND scroll up until you see this:

    Click the `ADRP`, switch to **Hex View**, click the second hex byte value, press **F2** to edit change a digit then save it (it varies in each version of the game). It should be like this after editing:

    And there we go! iOS is done.

## Removing world mode restrictions
!!! tip "Info"
    Unlocks all world mode charts (even byds as well i think because it counts as a world song but it just the visual, you'll need to mod the other 3 to make it playable offline).

=== "Android"

    In the **Strings** sub-window, search for `this song is`, xref the second one, **F5** to open the   **Pseudocode** sub-window and scroll up until you found this:

    | Xref | Pseudocode |

    Double-click to go to the highlighted address, click the first line in **Pseudocode** sub-window, press **Tab** to move to **IDA-View**, switch to **Hex View**, press **F2** and type `01 20 70 47` (no spacing) (which is MOV R0, #1 and BX LR).
